# 👋 Hi, I’m Manjeet Kumar Ashiyana

I’m an aspiring **Business Analyst / Data Analyst** who enjoys working with data and finding insights that actually matter. Over time, I’ve built skills in *SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Python, and I’ve applied them in projects around **sales, supply chain, and customer behavior**.

### Coming from a **medical background family**, I also have exposure to **healthcare operations and industry workflows**, which gives me an edge in connecting analytics with real-world processes. Along with my technical skills, I bring **business acumen** that helps me link numbers to outcomes like revenue, margins, and customer growth.
